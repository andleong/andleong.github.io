                    <b>Compound.me</b> helps you easily calculate your potential <b>future wealth</b> using the power of compound interest! 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This tool is perfect for finding out the future value of any of <b>your assets</b>, including your property, term deposits, bonds and shares...really anything that changes in value over time!
                </p>
                
                <ul>All you need is:
                    <li>The value of your asset today</li>
                    <li>The number of years you will own the asset for (e.g. half a year = 0.5, a quarter of a year = 0.25, one month = 0.08333, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Your expected yearly return on the asset (note: you can freely estimate this if it is unknown!)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Here are some powerful ways to use Compound.me</h4>
                
                
                    <button class="exampleButton">Example: Your property<br></button>

                    You currently own a house worth $500,000 and are curious as to how much it could be worth in 20 years. Your research tells you that real estate in your area averages a 5% increase in value year on year.<br><br>
                    
                    To calculate, we would enter "500000" into <b>Amount</b>, "20" into <b>Time</b>, and "5" into <b>Interest</b>.<br><br>
                    
                    That should give us $1,326,648,85!<br><br>
                    
                    However, your friend who works in real estate tells you that the assumption that your property value will grow by 5% per year is slightly off and should be 4.9%, but assures that it doesn't make much of a difference. Out of curiosity you decide to enter "4.9" into <b>Interest</b> instead of "5"...<br><br>
                    
                    ...giving us a value of $1,301,606.68. A difference of $25,042.17!<br><br>
                    
                    This goes to show just how sensitive your future value is to your estimates of yearly return - especially when you are looking far into the future.<br><br>
                    
                    This example also shows just how important it is to <b>do your own research</b> and come up with an educated estimate of your asset's growth rate. We also recommend that you test out a range of estimates for <b>Amount, Time, and Interest</b> to give you a possible range that your asset value could fall under. Even the best of us aren't fortune tellers!
